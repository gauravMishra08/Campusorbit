# CampusOrbit PWA Setup

Your CampusOrbit website has been configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA)! Here's what this means and how to complete the setup:

## What's a PWA?

A Progressive Web App allows users to:
- **Install your app** directly from their browser to their device
- **Use it offline** with cached content
- **Get native app-like experience** with app icons and fullscreen mode
- **Receive push notifications** (future feature)

The following PWA features have been implemented:

### 1. Web App Manifest
- Configured in `vite.config.ts` with app metadata
- Includes app name, description, theme colors, and display settings
- Ready for installation prompts

### 2. Service Worker
- Automatic caching of app resources
- Offline functionality
- Background sync capabilities

### 3. App Icons
- Icon generator created at `/public/icon-generator.html`
- Open this file in your browser to generate all required icon sizes
- Download and place icons in the `/public` folder

### 4. Install Prompt
